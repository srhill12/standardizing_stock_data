#  README Standardizing Stock Data

For this project, I will standardize stock data and use the K-means algorithm to cluster the data.

## Steps

1. Read in the `stock_data.csv` file from the `Resources` folder and create the DataFrame. Make sure to set the "Ticker" column as the DataFrameâ€™s index. Then, review the DataFrame.

2. To preprocess the data, use the `StandardScaler()` function and the `fit_transform` function to scale all the columns containing numerical values. Review a five-row sample of the scaled data using bracket notation ([0:5]).

3. Create a new DataFrame called `df_stocks_scaled` that contains the scaled data. I will make sure to do the following:

   * Use the same labels that were referenced in the `StandardScaler` for the column names.

   * Set the index for the new DataFrame to the "Ticker" column of the original DataFrame.

   * Review the scaled DataFrame.

4. Encode the "Sector" column using `pd.get_dummies`, and save the result in a separate DataFrame called `sector_encoded_df`.

5. Using the `pd.concat` function, I will concatenate the `df_stocks_scaled` DataFrame with the `sector_encoded_df` DataFrame along the column axis. I will then review the concatenated DataFrame.

6. Using the concatenated DataFrame, I will cluster the data by using the K-means algorithm and a k value of 3. I will then create a copy of the concatenated DataFrame, and then add the resulting list of company segment values as a new column.
